## 👋 Hey, I’m Bill

I’m a **Technical Support / Customer-Facing Engineer** who enjoys digging into 🔍 **real production problems** and turning them into 🔧 **practical solutions**.

Most of what you’ll find here comes from hands-on work with:
- ⚙️ **Automation** — reducing manual, error-prone workflows  
- ☁️ **Cloud-native systems** — containers, services, and production environments  
- 🧪 **Debugging & troubleshooting** — logs, configs, data, and edge cases  
- 🤖 **Applied AI** — using AI to make tools and workflows smarter, not gimmicky  

I’m especially interested in building **small, useful tools** that improve reliability, save time, and help teams move faster without adding complexity. These projects are often born out of real support cases, side experiments, or “there has to be a better way to do this” moments.

📦 Feel free to explore, fork, or borrow ideas.  
💬 If something here sparks a conversation, I’m always happy to connect.
